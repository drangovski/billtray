# Billtray - A household expenses management system

Billtray is my personal project for tracking my expenses as a tenant. I wanted to expand my Django skills and in the same time I was tired from using spreadsheets for my monthly expenses calculations, so that's why I came up with the idea of building Billtray. 

Some of the current features (as you can see by the images below) are visualized tracking of total expenses on monthly base (Dashboard), adding and management of different types of services, adding recurring bills, alerts for overdue and due bills, email reports for overdue, due, missing bills and monthly expenses.

It is not completed 100% precent and there are still many things to be polished and improved, but I am sharing this project here in case if someone want to expend over it.
